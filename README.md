# README

This is a demo build as a result of completing Wes Bos' [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) course.

Whilst the course is complete, this is far from a 'finished' website.

The website uses:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/))
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for Data Management
- [Keystone.js](https://www.keystonejs.com/) as a GraphQL Server &amp; Headless CMS
