# README

This is a demo build as a result of completing Wes Bos' [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com/) course.

Whilst the course is complete, this is far from a 'finished' website.

The website uses:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/))
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for Data Management
- [Keystone.js](https://www.keystonejs.com/) as a GraphQL Server &amp; Headless CMS

## Run the website

I'm yet to put this website online but you can run it locally. To do so, you'll need to:

- `cd` to wherever you want to store the code
- `git clone https://github.com/JamesNock/sick-fits.git`
- `cd sick-fits`

You'll then want to open the frontend folder in one terminal window and the backend in another one.

In the backend folder, run `npm run dev`. Once that is running, do the same in the frontend folder.

The website will then be viewable at `http://localhost:7777`
